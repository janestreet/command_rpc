  (** [Command] is used for setting up an RPC server in the child process communicating
      with the parent over stdin&stdout. By default this will use an Async RPC protocol,
      but passing the [-sexp] flag will make it use a sexp-based interface. Passing the
      [-menu] flag will cause the command to print out a sexp indicating which RPC names
      and versions are supported.

      Since stdout is used for communication with the parent process, it's not available
      for use as a debug output channel. We remap the file descriptors in the child in
      such a way that any attempted write to stdout gets sent to stderr instead. Then
      stderr can be forwarded to stderr of the parent if [propagate_stderr = true]. *)

          become determined when the client closes their connection, after which you may
          do any cleanup you need and then exit (possibly with an appropriate exit
          status).

          This interface is marked [Expert] because consuming from stdin or writing to
          stdout during your initialization may prevent you from receiving RPCs or
          responding to them properly, but we cannot check that you don't do this or
          prevent you from doing it, so you just have to be careful.
